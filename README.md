# Asgard Enterprises Splash!

This repository contains the code for displaying, developing and building the static splash page for Asgard.

You can check it out at [asgard.tech](http://asgard.tech)!


## Developing the product
The page is hosted via GitHub's organisation pages, meaning the `master` branch is for packaged and ready to go site snapshots only. Whatever's in the master branch is what will be displayed on the web.

If you want to see the not-so-complex magic and possibly contribute, please check out the `develop` branch of this repository.
